**Prompt:**

Open Table has a public API available at https://platform.opentable.com/documentation/#authorization that you can use to get restaurant information, including restaurant details and delivery information. As an example, http://opentable.herokuapp.com/api/restaurants?city=toronto returns a list of restaurants that deliver to Toronto, including some basic restaurant information.
 
The task is to create an application that accepts a City as a parameter. The application should then display the following information about each restaurant that delivers to that City:
- Name
- Address
- Price

**Instruction:**

User can type the city name in the input box and click the search button, then the application will return the information required in the prompt.

**Use Cases:**

As a **user running the application**, 

I can **view a list of restaurants in a user submitted City (e.g. Toronto)**

So that **I know which restaurants are currently available**
